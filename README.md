# ember.js UI


**WARNING : This is not production ready!!!**

I created those widgets to learn emberjs and I welcome any tips or contributions to grow the number of widgets. There is no roadmap to new widgets. 

## Widgets


There is only two widgets for now:

1. UI.ListView
2. UI.SelectView
3. TreeView
4. UI.ScrollerView
5. UI.VirtualScrollerView ([jsFiddle](http://www.jsfiddle.net/Z7SCN/12/))

## Themes

Everything is done using CSS. Browsers that do not support border-radius or gradients SHOULDN'T get the same experience as modern browsers[1].
